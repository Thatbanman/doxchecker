# DoxChecker ✅

Dox checker is a tool that allows you to check
the website "Doxbin" For your username.
This readme is very short so I'd enjoy
if you took the time to read it

# **How it works** ⚙️
it uses the python script "ddgs" to search
the website for your name. Sometimes
this might incorrect, since it doesnt
check the / branch for your usernames,
but its good for a normal user.
Also might fix it later

## Ending 📕
Thanks for reading. Install requirements.txt, then run doxchecker.py
